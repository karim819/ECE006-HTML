    <h1 style="text-align:center">c++ language</h1>
    <p>C++ is a language of middle level allowing it the benefit of low-level programming (drivers, kernels)<br>
And higher-level software (games, GUIs, desktop software etc.). All C and C++ have the same basic syntax and code structure</p>
  <h3> Applications of C++</h3>
  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>Application Software Development</li>
	  <p>C++ programming was used to build almost all of the main operating
	  systems such as Windows,<br> Mac OSX and Linux. In addition to the operating systems,
	  other browsers, such as Mozilla<br> Firefox and Chrome, have written the central component
	  using C++. C++ has also been<br> used to build MySQL, the most popular database system</p>
      <li>Programming Languages Development</li>
	  <p>C++ was commonly used in the development of
	  modern programming languages such as C #, Java ,<br>
	  JavaScript, Perl, UNIX 's C Shell, PHP and Python, and Verilog etc.</p>
      <li>Games Development </li>
	  <p>C++ is extremely fast, enabling programmers to do procedural 
	  programming for CPU-intensive functions,<br> and having greater hardware power,
	  as a result of which it has been widely used in gaming engine development.</p>
      <li>Embedded System</li>
	  <p>C++ is used extensively in the production of medical and engineering 
	  applications such as MRI machine software, CAD / CAM high-end systems etc.</p>
