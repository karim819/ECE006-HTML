    <h3> programming languages History </h3>
    <p> A few years after the work of Von Neumann the language Short Code appeared in 1949 (www.byte.com).
This was the first programming language for <br>electronic devices and involved a manual conversion of the programmer's statements into 0s and 1s.
This was, however, the first step towards<br> today's complex languages In 1951, Grace Hopper wrote the first compiler, <br> (www.byte.com). A compiler is a program 
	that turns the language’s statements into 0’s and 1’s for the computer to understand.<br> This lead to 
	faster programming, as the programmer no longer had to do the work by hand.<br>
      In 1957, the first of the major languages appeared in the form of FORTRAN. 
	  Its name stands for FORmula TRANslating system. <br>The language was designed at 
	  IBM for scientific computing. The components were very simple, and provided<br> 
	  the programmer with low-level access to the computers innards. Today, this language 
	  would be considered <br>restrictive as it only included IF, DO, and GOTO statements,
	  but at the time, these commands were a big step forward.<br> The basic types of data 
	  in use today got their start in FORTRAN, these included logical variables (TRUE or FALSE),
	  and integer, real, and double-precision numbers.</p>
    <br>
    <h3> what is The syntax!!!.. </h3>
    <p>Code is written in a language which a machine is able to understand. The programming languages are hundreds of different, 
	<br>each with its own logic and syntax.A programming language has its own syntax, consisting of a set 
	<br>of rules which dictate how words and symbols can be put together to form a program.<br>
      In programming language the idea of syntax is close to the principles of grammar and spelling in spoken language.<br>
	  If a sentence has very weak grammar and spelling in English, it is difficult to understand, or even impossible.
	  <br>Similarly the program does not run when code has syntax errors.</p>
      <br>
    <h3>Statements </h3>
    <p>Statements are the underlying unit of code. A statement may assign a value to a variable, 
	perform a single action,<br> control the execution of other statements and do other things as many
	as possible. A sentence is a single line of code which is doing something. </p>
    <br>
    <h3> Variables </h3>
    <p>Variables are used on programming languages. You may think of a variable 
	as a container where a value<br> can be retrieved at any time. In other words
	, variables store information. Variable names may be just 
	<br>about anything, but they usually can not start with a number 
because a number will confuse the first part of the variable. 
	<br>Now with the string you can do something.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <p>An implementation of a programming language provides a way to write programs 
	in that language and execute them <br>on one or more configurations of hardware 
	and software. There are, broadly,<br> two approaches to programming language 
	implementation: compilation and interpretation. It is generally possible to implement 
	<br> a language using either technique. The output of a compiler may be executed by 
	hardware or a program called an interpreter.<br> In some implementations that make use 
	of the interpreter approach <br>there is no distinct boundary between compiling and interpreting.</p>
