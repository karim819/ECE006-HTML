    <p>C is a general-purpose, high-level language originally created at Bell Labs by Dennis M. 
	<br>Ritchie to build the UNIX operating system C was originally first implemented on the DEC PDP-11 computer in 1972.<br>
      In 1978, Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie produced the first publicly available description of C,<br> now known as the K&R standard.. C has now become a widely used professional language for various reasons : <br>
      Easy to learn<br>
      Structured language<br>
      It produces efficient programs<br>
      It can handle low-level activities<br>
      It can be compiled on a variety of computer platforms<br></p>
