    <h1 style="text-align:center"> java language </h1>
    <p>In June 1991, James Gosling launched a Java language framework for use in one 
	<br>of his many experiments on the set-top box.
The language, initially called 'Oak' after an oak tree standing outside Gosling's office, <br>also went by the name 'Gray' and was later renamed Java, from a random word list. In 1995 Sun released Java 1.0 as the first public implementation..<br> </p>
      <p>The qualities of Java is ::
        <ul>
          <li>Object Oriented</li>
		  <p>All in Java is an Object. Java can be extended easily, because it is based on the Object model</p>
          <li>Portable</li>
		  <p>Being architecturally neutral and not making elements of the specification based on
		  <br>implementation makes Java portable. The Java compiler is written in ANSI C with a clean portability cap which is a POSIX subset</p>
          <li>High Performance </li>
		  <p>Java allows high performance with the use of the Just-In-Time compilers.</p>
          <li>Dynamic</li>
		  <p>Java is considered more robust than C or C++ because it is built to be adjusted to a changing environment.
		  <br>Java programs can hold vast quantities of run-time information that can be used to test and resolve object accesses during run-time.</p>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p> <h3>Applications on java :</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Games</li>
        <li>Web applications</li>
        <li>Mobile applications (specially Android apps)</li>
        <li>Web servers and application servers</li>
        <li>And much, much more!</li>
      </ol>
